      {% endif %}

## Materialization strategy

- start with `view`
- when it takes too long to query, switch to `table`
- when it takes too long to build, switch to `incremental`
    - config setup
    {% config( materialized='incremental', unique_key='') %}
    - identify new rows
        -  more to learn from dbt course `Advanced Materializations`



## when to use

- full-refresh

- fail-fast
